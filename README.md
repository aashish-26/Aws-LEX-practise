🚀 Diving into Amazon Lex – My First Chatbot Experience!

I recently played around with Amazon Lex and built a simple chatbot as a learning experiment. Nothing too fancy — just the basics:

✅ Welcome Intent to greet users.

✅ Fallback Intent to handle unexpected inputs.

❌ No Lambda Functions because I wanted to keep it lightweight and cost-free.



Even with just these features, I found Amazon Lex pretty impressive! The setup was smooth, and I can see how powerful it can be with more advanced integrations.

Next on my list? Exploring databases, Integrating Lambda Functions, API connections, and making conversations more dynamic. Looking forward to learning more!

Huge thanks to NextWork for this project! 🙏
